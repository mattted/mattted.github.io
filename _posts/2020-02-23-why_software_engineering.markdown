It seems a simple enough question, so it's a little puzzling why it's so difficult for me to answer. I often default to explanations that allude to my love of problem solving, the technical and analytical nature of the career, the seemingly limitless bounds for creativity within a set of unambiguous constraints. And while those are all aspects of a job that I find particularly appealing, I had all of those things in my career before deciding to make this jump into something new. So why make a switch?

It may be too simplistic to say that I just love working with computers, and it doesn’t make for a particularly insightful comment on my thoughts on software engineering in general, but it’s relatively close to the truth. I love the process of understanding how a piece of software works and interacts with a computer. Peeling back layer after layer of complexity to figure out how things function behind the scenes while gaining an understanding of the languages and concepts that make everything fit together. Ultimately, I get immense satisfaction from turning that fundamental understanding and ability to write in a programming language into solutions for anything from simple to complex problems.

Outside of my fascination with computers, software and programming, I love how dynamic software engineering is as a profession. The technology, languages, and programming paradigms seem to be constantly shifting, bringing a continual need to expand your knowledge and stay up to date. With such a perpetually changing landscape, there seems to be an endless number of facets to the software engineering industry. I’m hoping that through dedication to the Flatiron program, as well as dedication to learning everything from the fundamental to advanced skills necessary to be a successful developer, I’ll be able to find my own facet within the industry.
